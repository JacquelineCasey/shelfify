# Shelfify

A web app for organizing my bookshelves, and for developing skills in Python, 
Flask, HTML, and Heroku.

## Running Shelfify

Pushing to the main branch of this repository causes Heroku to build and deploy
the production version of the app, which can be found at 
https://shelfify.herokuapp.com/.

To run the app locally on VSCode, you can simply hit `F5`.
